## Foosched: live update Linux kernel scheduler
Foosched is a SDK that enables live updating the Linux kernel scheduler. It can dynamically replace the scheduler subsystem without rebooting the system or applications, with milliseconds downtime. Foosched can help developers to dynamically add, delete and modify kernel scheduling features in the production environment, which allows customizing the scheduler for different specific scenarios. The live-update capability also enables rollback.

## Motivation
* **Different policies fit for different scenarios:** In the scenario of cloud-computing, optimizing scheduling policies is complex, and an one-fit-all strategy does not exist. So, it is necessary to allow users to customize the scheduler for different scenarios.
* **Scheduler evolved slowly :** Linux kernel has been evolved and iterated for many years, and has a heavy code base. Scheduler is one of the core subsystems of the kernel and its structure is complex and tightly coupled with other OS subsystems, which makes the development and debugging even harder. Linux rarely merges new scheduling classes, and would be especially unlikely to accept a scenario-specific or non-generic scheduler. Foosched can decouple the scheduler from the kernel, and developers can only focus on the iterative development of the scheduler.
* **Updating kernel is hard:** The scheduler is built into the kernel, so applying changes to the scheduler requires updating the kernel. The kernel release cycle is usually several months, which makes the changes not able to be deployed quickly. Furthermore, updating kernel is even more expensive in the cluster, which involves application migration and machine downtime.
* **Unable to update a subsystem:** kpatch and livepatch are live update techniques of function granularity, which have weak expressive ability and cannot implement complex code changes. For eBPF, it doesn't support the scheduler well yet, and even if it were, it would only allow small modifications to the scheduling policies.

## How it works
The scheduler subsystem is built into the kernel, not an independent module . And it's highly coupled to other parts of the kernel. Foosched takes advantage of the idea of modularization: it provides a boundary analyzer that determines the boundary of the scheduler subsystem and extracts the scheduler from the kernel code into a separate directory. Developers can modify the extracted scheduler code and compile it into a new scheduler module and dynamically replace the old scheduler in the running system.

For functions, the scheduler module exports some **interface** functions. By replacing these functions in the kernel, the kernel can bypass the original execution logic and enter the new scheduler module, thereby completing the function update. Functions compiled in the scheduler module are either interface functions, or **insiders**. Other functions are all called **outsiders**.

For the data, foosched divides data into private data and shared data. Private data is allocated memory independently within the module, while shared data shares memory between the module and kernel. For global variables, they can be converted to private data by redefinition or to shared data by declaration. By default, static global variables are marked as private data and non-static global variables are marked as shared data. But to make the system work better, we manually adjusted the classification of some global variables in the boundary configuration file.

Data state synchronization is a core problem when updating the module. Data is divided into critical data and non-critical data according to whether the data state needs to be rebuilt. Critical data includes rq, cfs_rq, rt_rq, dl_rq, cfs_bandwidth, sched_class, sysfs, debugfs, sched_features, timer, and others are non-critical data, such as sched_domain_topology, task_group_cache, sysctls of scheduler, tracepoint and cpumask related to scheduler, and so on. Foosched uses sched-rebuild technology to rebuild the critical data state of the scheduler. For non-critical data, private data does not require synchronization, and shared data is inherited automatically, which without additional processing. The general data rebuild technology solves the state synchronization problem ingeniously.

|           |  critical data  |  non-critical data  |
|-----------|:---------------:|:-------------------:|
|  private  |     rebuild     |       re-init       |
|   shared  |     rebuild     |       inherits      |

**It is important to note that the size of structures and the semantics of their members cannot be modified arbitrarily. If new members need to be added, it is recommended to use reserved fields that are predefined in the structures.**

### Boundary Extraction
The scheduler itself is not a module, so it is necessary to determine the boundary of the scheduler for modularization. The boundary analyzer extracts the scheduler code from the kernel source code according to the boundary configuration information. The configuration mainly includes source code files, the interface functions, etc. Finally, the code within the boundary is extracted into a separate directory.  The process is mainly divided into the following steps.

* Gather Information
  Compile the Linux kernel and use gcc-python-plugin to collect information related to boundary analysis, such as symbol names, location information, symbol attributes, and function call graph, etc.

* Boundary Analysis
  Analyze the gathered information, calculate the code and data boundaries of the scheduler according to the boundary configuration, and determine which functions and data are within the scheduler boundary.

* Code Extraction
  Use gcc-python-plugin again to extract the code within the boundary into the kernel/sched/mod directory as the code base for the new scheduler module.

### Develop the scheduler
After the extraction, the scheduler's code is put in a separate directory. Developers can modify the code and customize the scheduler according to different scenarios. Please see [Limitations](#limitations) for precautions during development.

### Compile and install the scheduler
After the development, the scheduler with loading/unloading and other related code will be compiled into a kernel module, then be packaged in RPM. After installation, the original scheduler built in the kernel will be replaced. The installation will go through the following key steps.
* **Symbol Relocation:** relocate the undefined symbols in scheduler module.
* **Stack Safety Check:** Like kpatch, stack inspection must be performed before function redirection, otherwise the system may crash. Foosched optimizes stack inspection in parallel, which improves efficiency and reduces downtime.
* **Redirections:** Dynamically replace interface functions in kernel with corresponding functions in module.
* **Scheduler State Rebuild:** Synchronize the state between the new and old scheduler automatically, which  greatly simplifies the maintenance of data state consistency.

## Use Cases
1. Quickly develop, verify and release new features, and merge them into the kernel mainline after being stable.
2. Customize and optimize for specific business scenarios, publish and maintain non-generic scheduler features using RPM packages.
3. Unified management of scheduler hotfixes to avoid conflicts caused by multiple hotfixes.

## Quick Start
Foosched currently supports Anolis OS 7.9 ANCK by default, and other OS need to adjust the [boundary configurations](./docs/Support-various-Linux-distros.md). In order to reduce the complexity of building a running environment, we provide container images and Dockerfiles, and developers do not need to build a development environment by themselves. For convenience, we purchased an Alibaba Cloud ECS (64CPU + 128GB) and installed the Anolis OS 7.9 ANCK. We will live update the kernel scheduler.

1. Log into the cloud server, and install some necessary basic software packages.
```shell
# yum install anolis-repos -y
# yum install yum-utils podman kernel-debuginfo-$(uname -r) kernel-devel-$(uname -r) --enablerepo=Plus-debuginfo --enablerepo=Plus -y
```

2. Create a temporary working directory and download the source code of the kernel.
```shell
# mkdir /tmp/work && cd /tmp/work
# yumdownloader --source kernel-$(uname -r) --enablerepo=Plus
```

3. Build and startup the container, and spawn a shell.
```shell
# cd foosched
# podman build -f Dockerfile.x86_64 .
# podman tag [Imageid] foosched-sdk:latest
# podman run -itd --name=foosched -v /tmp/work:/tmp/work -v /usr/src/kernels:/usr/src/kernels -v /usr/lib/debug/lib/modules:/usr/lib/debug/lib/modules localhost/foosched-sdk:latest
# podman exec -it foosched bash
# cd /tmp/work
```

4. Extract kernel source code.
```shell
# uname_r=$(uname -r)
# foosched-cli extract_src kernel-${uname_r%.*}.src.rpm ./kernel
```

5. Boundary analysis and extraction.
```shell
# foosched-cli init $(uname -r) ./kernel ./scheduler
```

6. The extracted scheduler code is in ./scheduler/kernel/sched/mod. Add a new sched_feature and package it into a rpm.
```diff

```shell
# foosched-cli build /tmp/work/scheduler
```

7. Copy the scheduler rpm to the host, exit the container, and view the current sched_features.
```text
# uname_r=$(uname -r)
# cp /usr/local/lib/foosched/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/scheduler-xxx-${uname_r%.*}.yyy.x86_64.rpm /tmp/work/scheduler-xxx.rpm

```

8. Install the scheduler rpm and then the new feature is added but closed.
```text
# rpm -ivh /tmp/work/scheduler-xxx.rpm
# lsmod | grep scheduler
scheduler             503808  1
# dmesg | tail -n 10

```

9. Open the new feature and we can see "I am the new scheduler: __schedule" in dmesg.
```text
# echo FOOSCHED_TEST > /sys/kernel/debug/sched_features
# dmesg | tail -n 5
[ 6092.924138] scheduler load: stop machine time is            249471 ns

```

10. Remove the scheduler rpm and then the new feature will be removed.

**Note: Cannot unload the scheduler module directly using the "rmmod" command! You should use the "rpm or yum" standard command to remove the scheduler package.**

## FAQ
**Q: Under the default boundary configuration, what does the scheduler contain after boundary extraction?**

Contains the following:

- [ ] autogroup
- [ ] cpuacct
- [ ] cputime
- [X] sched debug
- [X] sched stats
- [X] cfs rt deadline idle stop sched class
- [X] sched domain topology
- [X] sched tick
- [X] scheduler core

**Q: Which functions can I modify?**

After boundary extraction, all functions defined in the files in the kernel/sched/mod directory can be modified. For example, in the example of Quick Start, 1K+ functions of the scheduler can be modified. However, there are some precautions, please refer to [Limitations](#limitations).

**Q: Can I modify the scheduler boundary?**

Yes. The scheduler boundary can be modified by editing boundary configuration, such as modifying the source code file, interface function, etc. Please refer to [here](./docs/Support-various-Linux-distros.md). Note that if the scheduler boundary is adjusted, strictly testing is required before installing the scheduler into production environment.

**Q: What kernel versions does foosched support?**

Theoretically, foosched is decoupled from the kernel version. The kernel versions we have tested are 3.10 and 4.19. Other versions need to be adapted and tested by developers.

**Q: Can I modify functions defined in header files?**

Yes. Boundary analyzer also works for header files. Functions in kernel/sched/mod/\*.h can be modified, except those follows with a comment "DON'T MODIFY INLINE EXTERNAL FUNCTION".

**Q: Can structures be modified?**

Cannot modify the size of structures and the semantics of their members arbitrarily. The reserved fields can be modified if they are predefined in the structures.

**Q: Will there be a performance regression when the kernel scheduler is replaced?**

The overhead incurred by foosched can be ignored,  and the performance regression is mainly depend on the code modified by developers. After the benchmark test, the new scheduler has no performance impact if no modification was applied.

**Q: Is there any downtime when loading scheduler modules? how many?**

It depends on the current system load and the number of threads. In our tests, we have 10k+ processes running on a 104 logical CPU machine. And the downtime is less than 10ms.

**Q: What's the difference between foosched and kpatch? Do we achieve the same goal by optimizing kpatch?**

kpatch is live updating for function granularity, while foosched for subsystem-wide. Some capabilities cannot be achieved through kpatch optimization. For example, kpatch can not modify the __schedule function, and can not modify thousands of functions at the same time.

**Q: Does foosched conflict with the hotfix of Kpatch?**

Yes. The overlapped part between foosched and kpatch will be overwritten by foosched. However, we have designed conflict detecting mechanisms that can be used in the production environment.

**Q: Can I modify a function outside the scheduler boundary?**

Yes. We provide the [sidecar](./docs/Advanced-Features.md) mechanism to modify functions outside the boundary. For example, if we want to modify both the scheduler and cpuacct , we can use the sidecar to modify cpuacct.

## Supported Architectures
- [X] x86-64
- [X] aarch64

## Limitations
* Cannot modify the init functions because they have been released after rebooting. If you need to, please do it in module initialization.
* The interface function signature cannot be modified. And the interface function can not be deleted, but you can modify it to make it an empty function.
* Can not modify the functions with "DON'T MODIFY INLINE EXTERNAL FUNCTION" comment;
* We don't recommend modifying structures and semantics of their members at well. If you really need to, please refer to the working/boundary_doc.yaml documentation.
* After the scheduler module is loaded, you cannot directly hook a kernel function within the scheduler boundary, such as perf or ftrace tools. If you need to, please specify the scheduler.ko module in the command.
